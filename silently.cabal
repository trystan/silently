-- This tests the platform specific implementation.

-- NOTE: Cabal 1.10 can not deal with conditional (== if-else) options.  This
-- is why we depend on silently to test the platform specific implementation.
--
-- As a consequence we can not use Hspec for testing, as this would result in
-- depending on two different versions of silently at the same time!
